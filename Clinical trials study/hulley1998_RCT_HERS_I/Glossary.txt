Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is a way of analyzing results in clinical trials.
In an ITT analysis, participants are analyzed in the groups they were originally assigned to, even if they:

- didn’t follow the treatment exactly,

- stopped the treatment early,

- switched treatments, or

- dropped out.

Why researchers use it:

- It preserves the benefits of randomization

- It reflects real-world behavior (people don’t always follow treatments perfectly)

- It reduces bias that could make a treatment look better than it really is

Simple example:
If 100 people are randomized to a new drug and 20 stop taking it, all 100 are still analyzed as part of the drug group, not removed or reassigned.

Contrast with other analyses:

Per-protocol analysis: Includes only participants who followed the study rules exactly

As-treated analysis: Analyzes participants based on what they actually received

Bottom line:
👉 Intention-to-treat asks: “What is the effect of assigning this treatment?”
👉 Per-protocol asks: “What is the effect of actually taking this treatment as planned?”


| Analysis type      | Grouping based on   | Main risk                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Intention-to-treat | Original assignment | Dilutes effect (but unbiased) |
| Per-protocol       | Followed rules      | Selection bias                |
| As-treated         | Actual treatment    | Loses randomization           |



Per-protocol (PP) analysis looks at only the participants who followed the study protocol as planned.

In a per-protocol analysis, researchers exclude participants who:

- didn’t take the assigned treatment,

- stopped early,

- switched groups, or

- had major protocol violations.

Only the “ideal compliers” are analyzed.


Simple example
100 assigned to Drug A
→ 70 took Drug A correctly → analyzed

100 assigned to Placebo
→ 85 took placebo correctly → analyzed


So the analysis compares 70 vs 85, not the original 100 vs 100.


Why use per-protocol?

 - Shows the biological efficacy of a treatment

Answers: “Does the treatment work when taken exactly as intended?”

Main drawback (important ⚠️)

-Breaks randomization

-Introduces selection bias
(people who adhere are often healthier or more motivated)

That’s why PP results can overestimate benefit.

| Feature                 | Intention-to-treat  | Per-protocol               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Who is analyzed         | Everyone randomized | Only adherent participants |
| Preserves randomization | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No                       |
| Real-world relevance    | High                | Lower                      |
| Risk of bias            | Low                 | Higher                     |
| Typical use             | Primary analysis    | Secondary/sensitivity      |


As-treated analysis analyzes participants based on what treatment they actually received, not what they were originally assigned.

If someone was randomized to Drug A but:

- never took it, or

- switched to placebo,

they are analyzed in the placebo group (or vice versa).

Simple example
Randomized:
100 → Drug A
100 → Placebo

What actually happened:
- 20 from Drug A switched to Placebo
- 10 from Placebo switched to Drug A

As-treated analysis:
- Drug A group = 90
- Placebo group = 110

Why use as-treated?

Reflects the effects of the treatment actually received

Answers: “What happened to people who took this treatment?”

Major limitation ⚠️

- Destroys randomization

- Strong risk of confounding and bias
(people who switch treatments are often different in important ways)

Because of this, as-treated results can be misleading.


| Analysis type      | Grouped by          | Keeps randomization? | Bias risk |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| Intention-to-treat | Original assignment | ✅ Yes                | Low       |
| Per-protocol       | Followed protocol   | ❌ No                 | Moderate  |
| As-treated         | Treatment received  | ❌ No                 | High      |
